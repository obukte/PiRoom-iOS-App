## PiRoom-iOS-App

Piroom iOS App

Piroom is an mobile app which creates an API connection using Google's Firebase services 
to provide data streaming between Rasberry Pi devices. 

Motion sensors are connected to each Rasberry Pi device and each device is connected to University network to
stream live data using Google Firebase API to iOS application users.

With iOS app students can view the availability of each studying room and try to find a study room 
without going on different levels of the campus buildings.
